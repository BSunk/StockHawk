# Stock Hawk


This is for project 3 of the Udacity nanodegree program. 

This program will take user selected stocks and update them every hour from the yahoo finance database. The user is notified when a stock has been added or when a stock could not be added because of an error. 

There is also a functional widget implemented to provide a list of stocks and the bid prices as well as the change in value. An intent will launch an activity to view the stock chart when a stock is clicked. 

A details page is implemented when selecting a stock which shows a chart of the price bids. The X values are the creation dates/times from the database and the Y values are the bid prices. A tooltip was implented to show the exact time and bid price selected. 

RTL is supported. 

Content descriptions are in place for all buttons.
